function block_min_ind = block_conver_cri41(ste_it, err)
% This function determines the minimal block-time (fixed point) in blocking 
% curves. It seeks the first three consecutive points in the blocking curve 
% that satisfy the following convergence criteria: 
% Criterion 1. The differences between nearest-neighbor, or consecutive, blocking points in the series must be smaller than the average of their error bars.
% Criterion 2. No three consecutive points follow the series, which are (i) monotonically increasing and (ii) violate criterion 1.
% Criterion 3. The last point in the series does not belong to the ultimate or penultimate point in the blocking curve. 
%-------Input----------------------------------------------------
% ste_it: 2D array of blocking curves with individual curves in rows
% err: error bars associated with blocking curves (standard
% errors).
%-------Ouput----------------------------------------------------
% block_min_ind: row vector of the index of the fixed points for blocking curves
